### Project
#### Sentiment Analysis
This project contains coding steps, from importing and data scraping to sentiment wordclouds. I sampled Mobile Legends app ratings on the Play Store, with a minimum of 3,000 entries. After collecting the data, 
I cleaned the text to perform sentiment analysis on the Mobile Legends app ratings. In this notebook, I Performed Sentiment analysis using scraped data related to Mobile Legends app ratings on the Play Store. 
This analysis used Feature Extraction (TF/IDF) techniques, Machine Learning Algorithms, and Training Set Accuracy.
#### Image Classification
This project developed a transfer learning-based CNN model to classify images of mammals, including African elephants, alpacas, and polar bears. The programming language used was Python. Methods use is 
MobileNetV2, Conv2D, Pooling, DenseModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping.

### Result
#### Sentiment Analysis
- There is sentiment polarity distribution 32.7% positive and 67.3% negative.
- There is training accuracy 97% and testing accuracy 88%.
#### Image Classification
- There is Test Loss 11.53%
- There is Test Accuracy 96.88%

### Conclusions
The projects successfully demonstrated practical applications of machine learning techniques. The Sentiment Analysis project effectively analyzed user reviews of the Mobile Legends app, achieving 
a high training accuracy of 97% and testing accuracy of 88%, with a sentiment distribution leaning towards negative opinions. The Image Classification project utilized transfer learning with MobileNetV2 to 
classify mammal images, attaining a strong test accuracy of 96.88% despite a test loss of 11.53%. Overall, both projects show promising results in their respective domains, highlighting the effectiveness of 
the applied models and methodologies.
